#### Overview

A physics-based puzzle game developed during the Scientific Game Jam 2023 in Montbéliard, France.
Players explore optical physics through engaging gameplay mechanics, manipulating lasers, mirrors,
and quantum elements to solve increasingly complex challenges.

#### Description

Optic Chambers is a puzzle game developed during the Scientific Game Jam 2023 in Montbéliard.
The game explores optical physics concepts through puzzle-solving mechanics where players manipulate lasers,
mirrors, and other optical elements to complete challenges.
Working alongside PhD students, we created an engaging way to demonstrate concepts like reflection, diffraction,
and quantum entanglement.

#### Intention

The project aimed to make complex physics concepts accessible through gameplay.
By collaborating with PhD students and researcher researching resonance chambers in optics wich have the emerging property
to quantumly
entangle photon, and in a more technichal way can be used as high end optic gyroscope.
We transformed academic research into an interactive educational experience while maintaining engaging gameplay mechanics.

#### Technical Highlights

- **Engine:** Unity 2023 then Unity 6.0
- **Language:** C#
- **Features:**
  - Real-time physics simulation
  - Dynamic laser reflection system
  - Quantum entanglement mechanics
  - Buttons and doors
  - Laser splitter
  - Laser with distance resource and booster

#### Team Leadership & Collaboration

- Led a cross-functional team of 4 members
- Managed project scope and technical architecture
- Mentored team members in Unity and Git workflows
- Coordinated with PhD researchers for scientific accuracy

#### Simplified Process

1. **Initial Game Jam (72 hours)**
    - Team skill assessment and task distribution
    - Rapid prototyping and core mechanics implementation
    - Basic feature implementation and MVP delivery
    - Debuging & testing
    - Presentation

2. **2025 Enhancement Project**
   - Unity 6.0 migration
   - Debugging
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Object movement Rework
   - New feature development (color lasers, liquid tanks)

#### Process

##### The Game Jam

As planning is really important, especially in short events like a 3-day game jam, the first day was spent planning
and making sure everyone had all the info, tools, and required skills.

At the beginning of the event, the PhD students and researchers presented their theses and we had to make a video game or
a board game around their thesis.

When we formed the original team I rapidly took the lead as the other members announced that they had no prior experience
in game development. I then did an assessment of the proficiencies of every member, to know what I could work with.

So after a small talk I had 1 Student Artist (Rayane Damage), 1 Physics Student (Grégory Grzesiak), and 1 maybe 2
people who could come to help a bit.

We then discussed about the thesis and decided to make a 2D Top-Down Pixel Art Puzzle-Game around optics.

I then did a small course to teach the base required skills (Working with GitHub, Unity, Aseprite for the Artist
I provided him with a copy).

After that we did a list of what needed to be done by whom, and what was priority.

As it started to be a bit late I encouraged everyone to go sleep as being fresh for the second day is really important as
it's when most of the project is done.

The next day we then started to work as everyone knew what to do. I started implementing the core features while Rayane was
drawing the assets, and Grégory was learning how to do the UI and making sounds for the game.

During the morning two friends of Rayane joined to help, so I assessed their skills and put them on making levels
on paper first, while learning how tilemaps and Unity in general worked. Once they could contribute I did a small
course on how to use GitHub, and the know-how for Unity projects.

We then continued to implement all the game features. The artist and his friends went home earlier (they were living close).
I stayed for the night till all features that should be in the MVP were functional™.

I then slept a few hours on site as did Grégory.

After a few hours of ~~Coma~~ Sleep, we looked at what the project still needed and I did debugging while others tried to do
some polish, documentation, and preparing for the presentation in the afternoon. After debug we tried to implement a few
optional features and the end of the allocated time arrived and we went to present the project.

We also talked with the other teams and went to see what they did.

##### Play-Tests

A few months after the Game Jam, an event where everyone came together again to have people come play the games was
organized. We then went and presented the game and allowed people to play.

##### Polishing the game

An occasion to put a good polish on the game arose so I managed to motivate a fellow developer to use the polishing of
this project as the evaluation project of a class we both attended.

We then made a fork, and went on with the work.

First planning what needed to be done:

- Updating the game to use Unity 6 (Nikolaos wanted to do this and use it as an occasion to learn how the game was made)
- Debugging the game
- Reworking the object movement with proper UI and inventory, and make the collision and exclusion games work
- Implementing secondary features (color laser and button, liquid tanks with diffraction)

### Crash Robots - GAMAGORA internal Game Jam 2025

#### Description

Project developed during GAMAGORA Internal Game Jam 2025.

The theme was death.

We decided to do a Minit like game were an astronaut is hit by an astroid and crashlanded on a planet.
And he need to use robots that have a 1 minute battery to find the part of his robots.

#### Intention

The project aimed to realize Leo's concept of creating a Minit-like game.
The player controls robots with a 1-minute battery life and must find their ship's lost parts after crash landing.
Various parts are locked behind obstacles that require specific abilities to bypass.

#### Technical Highlights

- **Engine:** Godot
- **Language:** GD Script
- **Features:**
  - Controllable player
  - Robot battery system with death on depletion
  - Enemies patrolling paths that drain player battery on contact
  - Pistol combat system
  - Dash ability for crossing rivers
  - Drill for destroying rocks
  - Collectibles (robot upgrades and ship parts)
